9/27/2013 14:02:39,2107,output,zyante,363489,Strongly disagree,It seemed very interesting filled with great material.,"Don't throw too much all in at once. I mean you people are pros at coding so for you it seems like no big deal, but to the average student who knows nothing about this they will feel overwhelmed, just like I did. I think if you are going to give a survey where people need to learn on the spot it needs to be long enough to engage them but short enough to keep them engaged. I was engaged for like 5 minutes but then once I saw how long it was and started reading all the material my mind started to wander and get lost and I found myself just putting random garbage into the quiz part. And honestly the display of the text was pretty blurry. But overall I think it was something new and I am definitely going to learn to program in C++. Especially since I kind of need to for my class but it seems EXTREMELY fun. I just need to take more time learning it. ",Yes,pictures on phone,Yes,I skipped some of the reading. I just want the gist of things
9/27/2013 14:08:19,3103,output,textbook,1332094,Strongly agree,I loved the hands-on experience!,"Nothing! Everything was completely easy to understand! Since I am a beginner in coding, this lesson made it easy. ",No,,Yes,
