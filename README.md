#Post processing for Digital Education Study using Ruby
The scripts included were used to analyze, parse and collect data from results collected in studies conducted at UC Riverside. The goal of the studies were to determine if interactive-based lessons developed on the web produce better learning than the traditional textbook lesson. These scripts, in particular \_script_DIGED_study.rb, parses the data, excludes bad data (outlined in ExclusionCriteria.log), tabulates scores, and leaves a debug trail of the data through the multiple steps between the initial parsing to the final results. The other scripts were used for extra analysis during the development of the main script just described.
